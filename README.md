🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: The Amazon Sales Dashboard! 🚀

I’ve developed a comprehensive sales dashboard using Excel that provides insights into our sales performance across various cities and states, along with a detailed breakdown by product. 📊

🔍 Key Highlights:

Total Sales: ₹1,02,26,625

Units Sold: 33,874

Cities Covered: 23

Top-Selling Product: Nestle Smarties Pop-Up (5,267 units)

💡 What You’ll Find in the Dashboard:

City-Wise Sales: Sales information for each city.

State-Wise Sales: Comparison of sales across different states.

Product-Wise Units: Overview of our best-selling products.

This dashboard is instrumental in tracking sales performance, enabling smart decision-making, and enhancing customer satisfaction. 🌟

I’m excited to leverage these insights for driving growth and success! Let’s continue making data-driven decisions! 📈
